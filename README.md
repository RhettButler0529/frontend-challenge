Answer

**1.** Explain the flow of data from the store to the UI and back as simply as you can.

The flow of data in a React-Redux application begins at the component level when the user interacts with the application UI. This interaction leads to the action creators dispatching an action. When an action is dispatched, it is received by the root reducer of the application and is passed on to all the reducers.

**2.** How else can we improve the experience of the site? What suggestions can you make to the product team and the development team?

We can make the design better than now, such as the logo position, and cart style, and so on.
And I think there should be product detail page too.

**3.** What recommendations can you make to the development team for scalability?

I think this project structure seems good.
If there is common functions such as backend call api function and so on, it would be better than now.

**4.** What knowledge up front could have helped this go smoother or faster?

React and Redux.

**5.** How was it working around these libraries? Anything trip you up?

I looked and understand about the createSlice of Redux in this project

**Sorry but I didn't do the remove unique cart part in this project due to the private problem. Hope you to understand me. Thanks in advance. **
